Indecisive Eaters is an app designed specifically for indecisive eaters. The app will incorporate Maps SDK and will allow users to find a variety of restaurants near them. First, the user will make an account using his/her email address so that later they can share their personal collections via email. For the backend data management, we will be using FireBase. After logging into the app, the user has two choices. They can either search for restaurants near them by entering the cuisine they want or the specific name of the restaurant or they can look into the lists saved. The application comes with two default lists: “want to go places” and “already been places.” Both lists can be edited and are sharable.   This application is designed to make picking out restaurants easier for foodies. NYC has so many restaurants and often times people forget about the places they’ve already been! Want to keep a personal review about the restaurant you just tried but too shy to write a Yelp review? Indecisive Eaters helps remind the users their favorite restaurants and favorite dishes by adding restaurants to their customizable folders and personalized notes that are saved on their devices. Shh.. no one needs to know about your favorite secret coffee spot.
